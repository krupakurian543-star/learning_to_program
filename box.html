        The best kind of motivation is self-motivation. 

But what is self-motivation? When you’re self-motivated, you do more than empower yourself to check things off the to-do list. 
Being self-motivated also means having enough self-awareness to know what works for you and what doesn't. Rather than depending on others to give you a reason for doing, your sense of motivation comes from within.
 Your drive comes from your interests, values, and passions, not someone else's checklist.
